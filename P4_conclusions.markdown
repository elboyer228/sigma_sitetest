## Limitations 
In this journey to uncover the factors contributing to an actor’s success, the Sigma Squad gained valuable insights into various elements that can influence career trajectories. However, these findings warrant deeper discussion. While some results have been moderately addressed on the previous page, others open the door for further exploration. Actors’ career paths are inherently complex, requiring a more nuanced analysis that considers additional factors. For instance:
	•	Data Depth and Nuances: The analysis relies heavily on averages and distributions, which might overlook individual circumstances or cultural influences that shape success.
	•	Intersectional Variables: Critical factors such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background, which can significantly affect opportunities and outcomes, are not considered in the current study.
	•	Dataset Limitations: Missing values in key features restrict the size and comprehensiveness of the dataset, potentially skewing the analysis.
	•	Focus on American Actors: The study predominantly examines American actors, limiting its applicability to global perspectives or other film industries.


## Future work 

Future research could expand on these findings by exploring additional dimensions:

- **Physical Traits:** Study how body type, facial features, and voice influence casting decisions and career success.  
- **Geographic Mobility:** Investigate how relocating to industry hubs impacts opportunities for actors from different regions.  
- **Family and Networking:** Examine the role of family connections and early mentorship in shaping success.  
- **Social Media Influence:** Analyze the impact of social media presence and engagement on casting and career growth.  
- **Educational Diversity:** Explore the success of actors with non-arts or alternative educational backgrounds.  
- **Genre-Specific Trends:** Identify how success varies across genres like comedy, horror, or drama.  
- **Streaming Platforms:** Study how streaming services influence casting, success metrics, and career trajectories.  
- **Diversity and Inclusion:** Assess how representation and industry biases affect opportunities and outcomes.  
- **Audience Perceptions:** Use sentiment analysis to link audience reception with critical and commercial success.  
- **Awards vs. Box Office:** Compare the long-term impact of critical recognition and commercial achievements.

These areas would provide a deeper, more holistic understanding of the factors driving success in the film industry.
